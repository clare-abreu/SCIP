# SCIP Coding Project 2022: Bootstrapping in Python

This repository contains data from an experiment competing five species of bacteria across six dilution factors. In the Colab notebook, we plot the competitive scores of the five bacteria, or their average fraction after competing with each of the other species. We use bootstrapping to calculate and plot the error bars of the competitive scores.

A video explaining these concepts can be found here: https://vimeo.com/713812601
